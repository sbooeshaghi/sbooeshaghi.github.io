          In many ways, the work of a critic is easy. We risk very little, yet
          enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves
          to our judgment. We thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to
          write and to read. But the bitter truth we critics must face is that,
          in the grand scheme of things, the average piece of junk is probably
          more meaningful than our criticism designating it so. But there are
          times when a critic truly risks something, and that is in the
          discovery and defense of the new. The world is often unkind to new
          talent, new creations. The new needs friends. Last night, I
          experienced something new, an extraordinary meal from a singularly
          unexpected source. To say that both the meal and its maker have
          challenged my preconceptions about fine cooking is a gross
          understatement. They have rocked me to my core. In the past, I have
          made no secret of my disdain for Chef Gusteau's famous motto: "Anyone
          can cook." But I realize, only now do I truly understand what he
          meant. Not everyone can become a great artist, but a great artist can
          come from anywhere.

          It is not the critic who counts; not the man [person] who points out
          how the strong man [person] stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could
          have done them better. The credit belongs to the man [person] who is
          actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and
          blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and
          again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but
          who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows the great
          enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy
          cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high
          achievement, and who at the worst, if he [they] fails, at least fails
          while daring greatly, so that his [their] place shall never be with
          those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.

          So, what we have here is a very well collected catalogue utterly
          devoid of either a conceptual framework or even an idea about primary
          motor cortex. Thus, in effect we have been given a (surely useful)
          database with some English sentences sprinkled on top of it. I do not
          see why this data base needs to be read in a journal. The experience
          is like a reading a phone book despite the fact that it is full of new
          information.

          Thus the duty of the man who investigates the writings of scientists,
          if learning the truth is his goal, is to make himself an enemy of all
          that he reads, and, applying his mind to the core and margins of its
          content, attack it from every side.

          It is the peculiar feature of political life that within it, behavior
          that could only otherwise be considered insane is perfectly effective.
          If you managed to convince everyone on earth that you can breathe
          under water, it won’t make any difference: if you try it, you will
          still drown. On the other hand, if you could convince everyone in the
          entire world that you were King of France, then you would actually be
          the King of France.

          To the mouse and any smaller animal it presents practically no
          dangers. You can drop a mouse down a thousand-yard mine shaft; and, on
          arriving at the bottom it gets a slight shock and walks away, provided
          that the ground is fairly soft. A rat is killed, a man is broken, a
          horse splashes. For the resistance presented to movement by the air is
          proportional to the surface of the moving object. Divide an animal's
          length, breadth, and height each by ten; its weight is reduced to a
          thousandth, but its surface only a hundredth. So the resistance to
          falling in the case of the small animal is relatively ten times
          greater than the driving force.
