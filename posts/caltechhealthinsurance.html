        A direct cost comparison of two PPO health insurance plans for Caltech
        and JPL staff reveals that one plan imposes a yearly financial penalty
        over the other for both Caltech ($1,865.28 per enrollee) and its
        employees (up to $957). This comparison reveals a pernicious cost
        extraction mechanism concealed as an illusion of choice by Anthem, which
        covered only 45% of charged claims in 2021.

    <h3>Caltech-offered staff health insurance plans</h3>
    <p>
      Open enrollment for Caltech-offered health insurance starts on October 11
      and ends on November 1. By the end of this three-week period, Caltech and
      JPL staff (postdocs, faculty, administrators, janitors, etc.) are tasked
      with understanding and selecting one of the four
      <a
        href="https://hr.caltech.edu/documents/4444/2022_Summary_of_Caltech_Benefits.pdf"
        >medical health insurance plans</a
      >
      offered through Caltech; note that staff members who have already selected
      a plan can modify their selection until the end of this period. Three
      plans are provided by Anthem and one by Kaiser, <b>Table 1</b>. Selecting
      one of these plans requires comparing the various costs, requirements, and
      covered services - a task further complicated by esoteric vocabulary,
      variability in covered services, and cost structures.

      deductible, and out-of-pocket maximum for four plans offered by Caltech.
      Coverage is the fraction of cost taken on by insurance, past the
      deductible, and up to the out-of-pocket maximum (OOPM). All plans cover
      100% of cost for covered services after the OOPM. This table was created
      by compiling costs from each plans benefits summary. PPO coverage has some

      One important distinction between these four plans is their type. Health
      Maintenance Organization (HMO) plans require enrollees to have a primary
      care provider and to get specialist referrals for special health issues,
      whereas Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) plans do not. Additionally,
      enrollees who hold a J-1 visa are

        >restricted to HMO plans only</a
      >. While comparing HMO plans to PPO plans is like comparing apples to
      oranges, the two Caltech-offered PPO plans offer identical coverage and
      can therefore be compared directly on the basis of cost alone.

      provides details on PPO plan coinsurance and health savings accounts
      (HSAs), but the only contrast made between the costs of the two PPO plans
      is between their deductibles. Additionally, the

      document appears to be the only resource that suggests including the cost
      of premiums in a cost analysis, offering an oversimplified equation for
      calculating health care costs that can be misleading. This seems to be the
      standard comparison drawn between PPO plans, namely that plans
      <a href="https://www.singlecare.com/blog/deductible-vs-premium/"
        >typically</a
      >
      offer either low deductibles with high premiums, or high deductibles with
      low premiums. However, as we will show in the case of the Caltech-offered
      PPO plans, the low deductible plan is always more expensive. To understand
      why, we must first understand health insurance cost structures for these
      plans.
    </p>
    <h3>An introduction to health insurance cost structures for PPO plans</h3>
    <p>
      Healthcare cost is determined by four dollar amounts: the premium,
      deductible, out-of-pocket maximum (OOPM), and cumulative amount billed by
      service providers (which resets yearly), as illustrated in
      <b>Figure 1</b>. The premium is a fee that is paid monthly to be enrolled
      in a health insurance plan. The deductible is the amount of money that an
      enrollee would need to spend, beyond the premium, before the health
      insurance company would start to share the cost burden. The OOPM is the
      absolute maximum that an enrollee would be required to pay in any one
      year, beyond the premium, for health insurance (for covered services).
    </p>

    <p>Medical expenditure for PPO plans an be broken up into four regimes:</p>
    <ol class="c15 lst-kix_8btyvvb1fbgr-0 start" start="1">
      <li class="c13 li-bullet-0">the premium to enroll in a plan,</li>
      <li class="c13 li-bullet-0">
        insurance covers 0% of costs until the deductible is reached,
      </li>
      <li class="c13 li-bullet-0">
        insurance covers 80% of costs (for covered services in network) until
        the OOPM is reached,
      </li>
      <li class="c13 li-bullet-0">
        insurance covers 100% of costs beyond the OOPM.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p class="c31">
      The costs that an enrollee is expected to pay under a given PPO plan
      depends on their medical expenditure. Since it is difficult to predict the
      exact medical services an enrollee will require over the course of a year,
      the cost to an enrollee (y-axis) of a given plan is plotted as a function
      of medical expenditure (x-axis) over the course of a year,
      <b>Figure 1</b>.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: 0.8em">
      <b>Figure 1: Healthcare costs for PPO plans.</b> The cumulative cost a
      consumer is expected to pay (y-axis) for a given cost of healthcare as
      billed by service providers to the insurance company (x-axis). Cost to
      consumer for a given value of medical expenditure is determined by the
      premium, deductible, coverage, and out-of-pocket maximum (OOPM).
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, a healthy staff member who uses no medical services would
      only pay for their healthcare premium (Regime I). An extremely sick staff
      member's charges beyond the premium could not exceed the OOPM (Regime IV).
    </p>
    <h3>A cost comparison of Caltech PPO plans</h3>
    <p>
      Caltech offers a simple equation for comparing the two PPO plans: add the
      premium and deductible to determine your healthcare costs, as the
      <a
        href="https://hr.caltech.edu/documents/3132/Tips_for_Selecting_a_Medical_Plan.pdf"
        >"Tips for Selecting a Medical Plan"</a
      >
      document suggests. PPO 1800 has a $1,860 premium and a $1,800 deductible,
      so an enrollee would need to spend $3,660 before insurance starts to kick
      in (red star, <b>Figure 2a</b>). On the other hand, PPO 3000 has a $648
      premium and a $3,000 deductible, meaning $3,648 before insurance kicks in
      (blue star, <b>Figure 2a</b>). Simply adding the premium and deductible
      shows PPO 3000 to be less expensive despite the higher deductible, though
      this may not necessarily be the case. In 2022 for example, the two PPO
      plans had different premiums and deductibles that led to the PPO
      3000-equivalent plan appearing more expensive by this heuristic, despite
      actually being less expensive. This is due to the different medical
      expenditures (x-axis) associated with the different deductibles (stars)
      that make comparing plans on the basis of premiums and deductibles
      potentially misleading.
    </p>

    <img
      alt=""

      style="display: block; margin: auto"

      title=""
    />
    <p style="font-size: 0.8em">
      <b>Figure 2: Healthcare costs for PPO plans.</b> The cumulative cost an
      enrollee is expected to pay for a given cost of healthcare as billed by
      service providers to Anthem (a) without considering tax savings, and (b)
      including tax-deductible-normalized premiums for a postdoc salary. Before
      tax savings are considered for each plan, the point at which insurance
      companies begin to share costs is marked with a star.
    </p>

    <p>
      A true apples to apples comparison corresponds to the vertical cost
      difference (y-axis) between the red and blue profiles for a given value of
      medical expenditure (x-axis) on <b>Figure 2a</b>. Such an analysis finds
      that a staff member would expect to save up to $1,212, but at least $252,
      with the lower premium plan (PPO 3000). The results of these cost
      comparisons and trends are consistent with those performed using
      <a href="https://livelyme.com/compare-health-insurance-plans/"
        >online calculators</a
      >, as well as
      <a href="https://health-plan-compare.com/">online visualization tools</a
      >that generate plots similar to those above. The
      <a href="https://mybenefits.caltech.edu/"> Caltech cost-estimator tool</a
      >enables Caltech staff to estimate their expected healthcare costs by
      inputting values for five different categories: emergency room visits,
      outpatient procedures, inpatient hospital procedures, doctor office
      visits, and prescription drugs. Based on these inputs, the tool will
      calculate the estimated annual cost for an enrollee. Cost estimates by the
      tool were found to be consistent with estimates for all regimes presented
      in <b>Figure 2a</b>, which do not account for tax savings based on the
      tax-deductible nature of premiums. The only tax-deduction setting that the
      tool offers is a cost-comparison that accounts for contributions to a
      health savings account (HSA), an optional tax-deductible account for
      managing health costs. Even with the maximum contribution to an HSA, the
      cost differences between the two plans remain consistent.
    </p>

    <p>
      These cost comparisons, while improved, do not account for the fact that
      premiums are taken directly from pre-tax income, essentially making them
      tax-deductible. For example, if a postdoc made the
      <a
        href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/california-employers-should-prepare-for-8503214/"
        >minimum</a
      ><a
        href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/california-employers-should-prepare-for-8503214/"
      >
        allowable postdoc salary</a
      >
      of $64,480 per year and her premium was $1,000 per year, then her taxable
      income would be $63,480 and the amount of taxes she would owe is $9,582.26
      ($220 less than taxes owed on $64,480). When taking taxes into account, a
      higher-premium health insurance plan could save an individual money due to
      a reduction in taxable income.
    </p>

    <p>
      A true cost comparison therefore requires consideration of this
      tax-savings. The higher premium plan would save $266.64 more than the
      lower premium plan, based on the taxes paid on postdoc income. Using this
      amount, the higher premium plan (PPO 1800) is "normalized" by subtracting
      out the difference in the amount saved by taxes between the two plans (<b
        >Figure 2c</b
      >). Interestingly, if health costs are below $2,982 or above $8,073, then
      the lower premium plan would be less expensive than the higher premium
      plan, and a postdoc would save up to $945.36. However, if health costs for
      the year fall in between $2,982 and $8,073, a postdoc would spend up to
      $14.64 more for the lower premium plan.
    </p>

    <p>
      Computing the average minimum and maximum cost savings with PPO 3000 for
      each tax bracket reveals that the maximum savings with PPO 3000 is always
      higher than the maximum savings with PPO 1800 across all income ranges,
      <b>Table 2</b>. For simplicity, it is assumed that deductions are entirely
      taxed within a single bracket.

      The potential savings always outweigh the potential costs, even with the
      savings decrease at higher income brackets due to higher marginal tax
      rates. Note that the potential savings are even higher in 2023 than in

    <p>
      For each enrollee, Caltech subsidizes $10,478.88 of the PPO 1800 plan
      premium, and $8,613.60 of the PPO 3000 plan premium annually. This means
      that Caltech pays Anthem an extra $1,865.28 annually for each staff member
      who chooses the PPO 1800 plan over the PPO 3000 plan. So when a postdoc
      chooses the PPO 3000 plan over the PPO 1800 plan, they could save
      themselves up to $957 annually, and they save Caltech $1,865.28 annually.
    </p>

    <p>
      Why is one PPO plan subsidized more than the other, when both offer
      identical coverage? According to a Caltech HR representative,
    </p>

    <p class="c21">
      <i
        >"They're [Caltech] offsetting more of the cost for this one [PPO 1800],
        otherwise they [enrollees] wouldn't want to elect it."</i
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      In other words, the purpose of the unequal subsidies is to incentivize
      Caltech employees to choose the more expensive plan. Whereas
      <b>Figure 2a</b> shows pre-tax PPO plan costs to only enrollees, the true
      pre-tax costs of the PPO plans to both enrollees and Caltech are
      illustrated in <b>Figure 3.</b>
    </p>

      <b>Figure 3: Healthcare costs.</b>
      The cumulative cost paid by enrollees and Caltech for a given cost of
      healthcare as billed by service providers to Anthem for both
      Caltech-offered PPO plans.
    </p>

    <p>
      When healthcare cost is above the diagonal dashed line, the insurance
      company makes a profit on an individual enrollee. The breakeven medical
      expenditure is $13,262 for the PPO 3000 plan, and $16,339 for the PPO 1800
      plan.
    </p>
    <h3>Total financial loss to Caltech</h3>
    <p>
      There is no way of quantifying the total financial loss to Caltech and JPL
      staff, and to the Caltech administration, without knowing how many staff
      members are enrolled in the PPO 1800 plan. When contacted via email for
      enrollment statistics across the 2022 equivalent of the four plans listed
      in <b>Table 1</b>, Caltech HR declined to disclose this information,
      stating:
    </p>

    <p class="c21">
      <i
        >"When it comes to providing employee data to the public, it is against
        our
        <a href="https://hr.caltech.edu/applicantprivacy">Privacy Notice</a
        >."</i
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      However, the Privacy Notice cited by Caltech HR is only applicable towards
      "Personal Information," defined as "any information that identifies or can
      be used to identify an individual," whereas this request was specifically
      for health insurance plan enrollment statistics, which clearly cannot
      identify nor be used to identify an individual. When this point was
      raised, Caltech HR once again declined to disclose this information,
      stating:
    </p>

    <p class="c21">
      <i
        >"The data you have requested is Caltech proprietary information.
        Caltech does not share this data except as needed to facilitate Caltech
        activities related to the administration of our benefits plan."</i
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      Without knowing how many staff members are electing the lower deductible
      PPO plan (PPO 1800, formerly PPO 1600), it is impossible to quantify the
      total financial loss to Caltech and its staff.
    </p>

    <p>
      Meanwhile, federally mandated public disclosures can be found by searching
      <a href="https://researchadministration.caltech.edu/osr/proposalinfo"

        >US Department of Labor Form 5500 Search page</a
      >. The 2021 Consolidated Welfare Plan filed by Caltech earlier this year
      reveals total enrollees, claims charged, and claims paid. Forms filed
      since 2020 indicate that Anthem covered only 38-45% of charged claims
      since 2019, <b>Table 4</b>. Note that the average claims charged per
      enrollee exceeds the medical expenditures associated with the in-network
      OOPM in <b>Figure 2a</b> and <b>Figure 3</b> for both PPO plans.

    <p>
      Anthem data in Form 5500 Schedule A is consolidated over three plans
      (yearly equivalents of PPO 3000, PPO 1800, and HMO plans), making it
      impossible to determine the plan-specific enrollment numbers and therefore
      the exact financial loss to Caltech, or to determine the variation in
      claims paid between different PPO plans.
    </p>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
      Caltech-offered health insurance plans PPO 1800 and PPO 3000 provide
      identical healthcare coverage, and can therefore be compared on the basis
      of financial considerations alone. Although the choice between the two
      plans is typically framed as either low deductibles with high premiums
      (PPO 1800) or high deductibles with low premiums (PPO 3000), the former is
      always more expensive than the latter, independent of medical expenditure.
      Once the tax-deductible nature of the premiums is considered (which the
      Caltech cost estimator tool does not account for), it is found that an
      enrollee could save up to $957 or lose up to $194 depending on their
      income level (and medical expenditure), by choosing the less expensive
      plan (PPO 3000). The potential savings outweigh the potential costs across
      all income levels, despite the fact that Caltech subsidizes the more
      expensive plan (PPO 1800) by an additional $1,865.28 per enrollee.
    </p>

    <h3>Discussion</h3>
    <p>
      These calculations assume in-network coverage for a single employee. The
      differences between Anthem PPO plans would not decrease if out-of-network
      coverage and family coverage were to be considered. In the case of
      out-of-network providers, Anthem covers 60% rather than 80% for both PPO
      plans. In the case of family coverage, deductibles and OOPMs vary
      equivalently between the two plans. Furthermore, since premiums scale with
      individual rates (~2.1x for spouse/partner, ~2.4x for child(ren), and
      ~3.7x for family), the absolute cost differences between the two plans
      would be even greater than those reported above.
    </p>

    <p>
      This analysis took time and effort that could otherwise have been spent on
      work, and raises more questions than answers. Is every Caltech and JPL
      staff member (postdocs, faculty, administrators, janitors, etc.) required
      to independently decipher these cost structures, meet with HR, and
      generate these plots on their own - or risk losing up to $957 (in the case
      of a postdoc)? Both Anthem PPO plans offer identical coverage, so why is
      the PPO 1800 plan objectively financially disadvantageous to enrollees
      across all income levels? How many Caltech and JPL staff members are
      enrolled in the more expensive plan - a statistic which Caltech HR has
      declined to disclose? How much money is lost annually by Caltech and JPL
      staff members who choose the more expensive PPO plan due to not
      understanding these cost structures? How much money is lost annually by
      the Caltech administration due to higher subsidies (additional $1,865.28
      per enrollee) on the more expensive PPO plan? Why does Caltech incentivize
      the more expensive PPO plan by subsidizing it more, when both PPO plans
      offer identical coverage? How does Anthem's 38-45% aggregate coverage of
      charged claims vary between its three Caltech-offered PPO and HMO plans?
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DAxqty5jaRP0">On what basis</a>
      were these PPO plan costs (premiums, deductibles, and OOPMs) determined by
      Anthem in the first place? The diversity of Caltech-offered Anthem PPO
      plans provides an illusion of choice, one of which (Anthem PPO 1800)
      effectively imposes an additional fee of up to $957 on its enrollees - and
      $1,865.28 on Caltech - due to not having taken the time to perform this
      analysis. It's clear that Anthem benefits from this system at the expense
      of Caltech and its staff.
    </p>
    <h3>Actions to protect Caltech from further unfair profit extraction</h3>

    <p>
      Caltech offers consultations with HR specialists as well as an
      <a
        href="https://hr.caltech.edu/departments/total-rewards/benefits/anthem-concierge"
        >Anthem Concierge</a
      >
      (who is
      <a
        href="https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Elevance-Health-1/reviews?fjobtitle%3DConcierge"
        >employed by Anthem</a
      >). After repeatedly raising concerns about the Anthem PPO 1600 plan to
      Caltech HR representatives directly via email and private meetings as far
      back as August 16, 2022, it came as a surprise that the costs of the 2023
      PPO plans (Anthem PPO 3000 and Anthem PPO 1800) released on October 10
      exacerbate the issues we raised (<b>Figure 4</b>).
    </p>

    <img

    />
    <p>
      <b>Figure 4: Year over year plan costs.</b>
      Changes in Anthem PPO plan costs relative to previous year for the (a)
      lower deductible PPO plan (PPO 1800, formerly PPO 1600) and the (b) higher
      deductible PPO plan (PPO 3000, formerly PPO 2800). (c) Change in Caltech
      subsidies for each PPO plan. (d) Difference between Caltech subsidies for
      different PPO plans in each year.
    </p>

    <p>
      Besides the salient $200 increase in deductible for each PPO plan, Caltech
      increased its subsidy for the more expensive plan (PPO 1800) by $503.52
      and decreased its subsidy for the less expensive plan (PPO 3000) by
      $475.44 (<b>Figure 4c</b>), resulting in an additional $975.96 loss to
      Caltech for each employee who chooses the former, relative to the previous
      year. Even with this higher subsidy difference between PPO plans (<b
        >Figure 4d</b
      >), the lower deductible PPO plan is still more expensive to enrollees:
      whereas the potential savings of the higher deductible PPO plan already
      outweighed the potential costs across all income ranges in 2022, this
      difference is even more stark in 2023 (<b>Table 2</b>) due to the larger
      difference between enrollee premiums.
    </p>

    <p>
      This article is a last resort to prevent Caltech and its staff from being
      further taken advantage of by Anthem. Anthem is a for-profit private
      health insurance company that is maximizing its profits at the expense of
      Caltech and its staff. The following actions can be taken to better
      understand and lessen the degree to which Anthem is unfairly extracting
      profits from Caltech:

        This must comprise of compiled costs (<b>Table 1</b>), plots of enrollee
        costs vs. medical expenditure for each plan (<b>Figures 2,4</b>), and
        savings/losses by tax brackets (<b>Table 2</b>). This would demonstrate
        that due diligence has been done and that differences between the PPO
        plans are understood, preventing nonsensical plans (such as Anthem PPO
        1800) from being offered to the Caltech community in the future. The

      <li class="c13 li-bullet-0">
        <b>Include tax-deductible savings in the cost analysis.</b>
        The current set of Caltech-offered cost-analysis tools do not include
        savings due to the tax-deductible nature of healthcare plan premiums. As
        demonstrated in <b>Figure 2</b> and <b>Table 2</b>, a cost analysis that
        does not account for this is incomplete.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p><i>Disclosure of disaggregated data</i></p>

    <ol class="c15 lst-kix_qzhgwyw8lsy-0" start="3">

        <b>Disclose disaggregated plan enrollment statistics.</b> Mandated
        public disclosure forms, such as the Form 5500 Schedule A, only offer

        plan-specific data.

        forms, such as the Form 5500 Schedule A, only offer aggregated claim
        data. This would help staff estimate their healthcare costs over the
        coming year, as well as to understand the profit margins that Anthem is
        making off of the Caltech community through each individual plan, which
        would provide leverage negotiating future healthcare plans and inform
        PPO plan choice.
      </li>

    <p><i>Caltech subsidies</i></p>

        <b>Subsidize all plans equally.</b> Caltech currently subsidizes PPO
        1800 by $1,865.28 more than PPO 3000, meaning that Caltech spends an
        extra $1,865.28 on every staff member who chooses the former over the
        latter, despite the former being generally financially disadvantageous
        to the enrollee.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <ol class="c15 lst-kix_qzhgwyw8lsy-0" start="6">

          >Reimburse plan subsidies to all staff members who are on healthcare
          plans not offered by Caltech (as long as minimum coverage requirements
          are met).</b
        >
        Since Caltech subsidies come out of staff paychecks, staff members who
        are not enrolled in Caltech-offered plans miss out on these subsidies.
        This applies to international postdocs who have foreign health insurance
        coverage, staff members who receive health insurance through a parent or
        spouse, and other staff members who require services that are better
        covered under other plans.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      These actions would assist Caltech and JPL employees in making more
      informed healthcare plan decisions, thereby saving themselves and Caltech
      money every year. Equal subsidies would eliminate plan selection and
      employee compensation on the basis of subsidized cost.
    </p>
    <h3>Broader context</h3>
    <p>
      This cost analysis is necessitated by the complexity of the U.S. health
      insurance system, which is often

        >contrasted</a
      >
      with the simplicity of the Canadian health insurance system. In Canada (or
      Spain, Italy, Sweden, the UK, or Japan, among
      <a
        href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/countries-with-single-payer"
        >other countries</a
      >), single-payer healthcare systems are in place where consumers do not
      have to worry about networks, premiums, co-pays, deductibles or plan
      comparisons. Healthcare costs are automatically accounted for through
      taxes, and result in

      than 37 million Americans do not have any health insurance, resulting in
      68,531 unnecessary deaths every year,

      prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. A further 338,594 lives and $105 billion
