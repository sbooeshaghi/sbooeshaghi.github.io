    "summary": "Evaluating the clustering of single-cell RNA sequencing data relies on the kNN graph through two dimensional embeddings produced with tSNE and UMAP. These two dimensional embeddings often fail to preserve local and global structure making it improper to rely on them as tools for assessing clustering quality. To overcome this challenge we develop the CONCORDEX measure, a quantity based on neighbors of cell types in a kNN graph, that more accurately and consistently enables clustering. We show how CONCORDEX performs on simulated data and illustrate its use on real data."

While single-cell registration can help better understand the coordination of distinct biological processes, an assessment of the multimodal and unimodal tradeoff has not yet been undertaken. To understand this tradeoff, we develop a snATAK, a preprocessing workflow for chromatin accessibility and \u201cmultiome\u201d assays. We show concordance with state-of-the-art, and demonstrate improved speed and runtime. Using snATAK we find that multimodal ATAC/RNA yields fewer peaks detected per cell, lower library complexity, and increased technical noise when compared to their unimodal counterparts. Additionally, we show that registered multimodal data can be used to find allele-concordance between the ATAC and RNA parts of 10x Multiome and SHARE-seqV2 data."

Specifically, we found high error rates in and near homopolymer stretches in Ultima data that led to erroneous quantification of some genes. We propose pseudoalignment as a method to compensate for these errors and show that it outperforms standard read alignment for this application."

We found tradeoffs between effective depth-normalization, variance stabilization, and monotonicity. We also found that the proportional fitting (PF) transformation followed by log(1 + X) can benefit from an additional PF with minimal loss to variance stabilization."
