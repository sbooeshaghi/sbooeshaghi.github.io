          <b>(102 words)</b> Orthogonal barcoding in single-cell genomics has
          made it possible to simultaneously measure numerous attributes of
          cells. We extended kallisto bustools to quantify orthogonal barcoding
          assays such as 10x Feature Barcoding, CiteSeq, Multiseq, and
          single-cell CRISPR screens. Our tool, called kite, is accurate and 48
          times faster than state-of-the-art methods while requiring only a
          fifth of the memory. It has already been used in numerous projects by
          others. We also introduced a set of quality control metrics, and
          accompanying tool (qcbc), for validating barcode designs. qcbc
          provides a method for assay developers to address the problem of
          ambiguous mapping barcodes prior to experimentation.

          <b>(101 words)</b> The expiration of Illumina patents has spurred the
          development of new sequencing assays and the launch of new sequencing
          companies. One of these is Ultima Genomics, which recently published
          articles showcasing its technology. We benchmarked and compared
          single-cell RNA-sequencing data generated with Illumina and Ultima
          Genomics sequencers and found some exaggerations in claims made by the
          company. Specifically, we found high error rates in and near
          homopolymer stretches in Ultima data that led to erroneous
          quantification of some genes. We propose pseudoalignment as a method
          to compensate for these errors and show that it outperforms standard
          read alignment for this application.

          <b>(102 words)</b> The accessing of data and metadata from the
          sequence read archive (SRA) and other genomics databases has been
          cumbersome, and a source of frustration for many biologists seeking to
          leverage published data in their work. We developed a command-line
          tool, called ffq, for querying user- generated data and metadata from
          sequence databases such as GEO, SRA, NCBI, EMBL-EBI, DDBJ, and ENCODE.
          ffq enables users to quickly and easily find FASTQ files associated
          with a paper or accession, and greatly simplifies and organizes the
          process of downloading data. This tool currently has 400 stars on
          GitHub and is downloaded ~200 times per week.

          <b>(90 words)</b> Single-cell count data normalization is a requisite
          for accurate interpretation of analysis results. However, a menagerie
          of methods has created confusion in the field, and there is
          disagreement about what methods to use in practice. We benchmarked
          widely used methods for normalizing scRNAseq data on 526 datasets in
          order to understand their performance and limits. We found tradeoffs
          between effective depth-normalization, variance stabilization, and
          monotonicity. We also found that the proportional fitting (PF)
          transformation followed by log(1 + X) can benefit from an additional
          PF with minimal loss to variance stabilization.

          <b>(79 words)</b> The proliferation of single-cell modalities

          a priority on high throughput approaches for diagnostics. We produced
          a COVID-19 diagnostic assay using next-generation sequencing of pooled
          samples. This assay, called SwabSeq, enables the testing of thousands
          of nasal or saliva samples for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in a single run without
          the need for RNA extraction. SwabSeq has an analytical sensitivity and
          specificity comparable to or better than traditional qPCR tests, and
          can be rapidly adapted for the detection of other pathogens. SwabSeq
          is currently deployed at UCLA and Caltech for their COVID-19

          <b>(68 words)</b> Instrumentation to perform single-cell
          RNA-sequencing experiments is costly and limits the scale of
          experimentation. To address this, we have developed an open-source
          syringe pump and microscope system called poseidon. The system of
          three syringe pumps and microscope costs less than $400, and can be
          assembled in under an hour. Importantly, poseidon reduces costs of
          experimentation by up to 25x while demonstrating similar accuracy and
          precision to commercial alternatives.

          <b>(44 words)</b> Heat exchangers cool industrial systems by rejecting
          waste heat to a thermal reservoir despite the heat's energetic
          potential. To convert waste heat into useable electric energy, we
          develop, build, and test a liquid-cooling heat exchanger that uses
          thermelectrics to convert waste heat into electricity.
